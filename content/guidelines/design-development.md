Accessibility
A well-designed website is accessible to users of all abilities, including those with low vision, blindness, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, or motor impairments. Improving your website’s accessibility enhances the usability for all users.
Logo
The City of Philadelphia logo is the most immediate representation of our city, our people, and our brand to the world. It is a valuable asset that must be used consistently in the proper, approved forms. There are 2 color versions of the City of Philadelphia logo provided. There are no absolutes regarding the selection of the specific color application, but context, contrast with regard to background color and surrounding imagery all should be considered. A black & white logo has also been provided for those instances where the logo must be a single color. The bell icon should ALWAYS stay yellow. The exception being when the logo must be all one single color.

General set of guideliness for logo usage is outlined as follows:
Do not recreate, crop, or reconfigure logo artwork
Logo artwork must be uniformly scaled
Logo artwork should appear against a solid background
Do not put a white box around the logo when placed on a dark background.
Do not reproduce the logo in colors other than those specified
Do not add drop shadows
Do not change the orientation of the logo
Do not put text on top of logo

For Departments
If you are a department that needs a logo, we provide 2 templates for you below. They follow the same design as the City of Philadelphia logo with the name of the department being the main focus. “City of Philadelphia” can go under the department name if you would like. Which version you use is up to you. If you need an avatar for your department social media channel, please use the template provided. It is simple and uses your department initials along with the liberty bell. This will make it recognizable and readable when smaller.

Accessibility
The City of Philadelphia Logo and department logos do not have to meet the contrast ratios, but it is important that they are recognizable. They use the Trebuchet font which is a standard sans serif font that is accessible across all devices and platforms. It is unique and has an artistic feel to it, but is still readable.


Typography
Montserrat is used to introduce sections of content on the site and is exclusively reserved for major headlines. Once we have their attention, we can draw them into the details with the highly-legible Open Sans.

Open Sans serves as the base font for the site. It is used to present the content details. Sans-serifs have been proven to be easier to read on-screen and are incredibly adaptable when resized and displayed across different platforms and browsers. Accordingly, Open Sans is used for body type, secondary and tertiary headlines, and instructional text.

Accessibility
Readability is key when picking fonts. Montserrat and Open Sans are 2 of the most readable san serif fonts. Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background. Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.


Color Palette
The color blue is one of our distinguishing features. It is an essential part of our brand identity. It is synonymous with being trustworthy, dependable and secure. Combined with shades of gray and white, the palette provides a welcoming feeling that is easy to read and is clean and simple. Use the accent colors to add some pop and draw attention to certain elements. Always use the accent colors sparingly.

Accessibility
Color contrast is critical when choosing text and background colors. The better the contrast, the easier it is to read. Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.
Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background. Here are the color combinations that work...



Iconography
Icons are via Font Awesome, the open source toolkit by @davegandy. We use iconography on phila.gov to provide a simple, easy-to-distinguish visual indicator of key actions or tasks while creating stronger contextual emphasis on the page.

Imagery
Carefully considered photography brings another dimension to our city’s brand identity. The pictures we use should be expressive, show real people and emotions and be cropped for maximum effect. The attributes to apply to pictures are enjoying, optimistic, natural, clear, simple, real people in real situations. Your aim should be to convey a photojournalistic approach, creating a true sense of place, depicting real-life interaction between people. Never contrived or cliched. Our beautiful city has a personality, too. It can be a way to reinforce our brand by showing it’s character and the interesting people who populate it. Use dynamic lines, interesting angles and interesting crops to show personality.

Guideliness:
Images must be at least 300 dpi
Must use imagery that is not visibly dated
Must be images that have been taken in Philadelphia
No iphone pics

Social Media
The branding that you use on your social media profiles should align with the City’s branding that we use on our website. If you create a social media site on behalf of the City of Philadelphia, use simple graphics that reflect the City’s brand. The City of Philadelphia’s brand should be reflected in your profile pictures, icons, and other imagery. For the City of Philadelphia, the header image should correspond to the header image that is currently on the phila.gov homepage. All City of Philadelphia social media platforms should have the same header image and profile pics. For Departments, your header image should match with the header image on your department site. Your profile picture can be your logo if you have one.


Tables
Tables are used to show data in columns and rows. Kelly drive green is used for the table header and medium and sidewalk gray alternate between rows for the content of the table.


Buttons
Buttons are used for actions. The default color for the button is electric blue. The text is dark gray. The hover states are dark gray with white text. An icon can be added if desired. “See all" buttons should be used at the end of any incomplete list, including news, notices, services & information lists--anything--to indicate that the link or button will take the user to a complete list of that type of information.


Headers/Footers
The header provides the city logo, site wide navigation and the search functionality. It helps us to navigate the whole site. There are 2 parts to the footer. The first footer provides 311 information. The second footer provides community links, city government links and all social media links.


Site Alerts
We have 2 types of alerts, city service updates and site wide alerts.

City Service updates are used to call out important time sensitive information. They can be used on the homepage and department landing pages if needed. They are to be used as a notification that keeps people informed of the status of the system and which may or may not require the user to respond. This includes errors, warnings, and general updates.

Site wide alerts are used to call out important information across the whole website. These are to be used in true emergencies only.
