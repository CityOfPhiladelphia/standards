{{< panel "This section of standards.phila.gov is a work-in-progress." >}}

The visual identity system for the City of Philadelphia consists of elements including the logo, color palette, typography, iconography and photographic style. They work together to create a look and feel that is unique to the City of Philadelphia. These standards help ensure a consistent design and identity.

The goals for creating this standards guide:
1. Streamline the workflow for designers and developers
2. Maintain a consistency of styles and identity
3. Create a focal point for our Design and User experience work, both for ourselves and for the community

## Accessibility
A well-designed website is accessible to users of all abilities, including those with low vision, blindness, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, or motor impairments.
