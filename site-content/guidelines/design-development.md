The City of Philadelphia's visual identity includes the City's logo, color palette, typography, and photographic style. Together, these elements create a look and feel that is unique to the City of Philadelphia. The design and development guidelines here were created by the Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation (ODDT) to help ensure a consistent design and identity.

The goals for creating this standards guide are to:

• Streamline the workflow for designers.  
• Maintain a consistency of styles and identity.  
• Create a central hub for the City of Philadelphia’s design and development work.
