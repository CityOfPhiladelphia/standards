The City of Philadelphia's visual identity includes the City's logo, color palette, typography, and photographic style. They work together to create a look and feel that is unique to the City of Philadelphia. These Standards help ensure a consistent design and identity.

The goals for creating this standards guide:

1. Streamline the workflow for designers and developers
2. Maintain a consistency of styles and identity
3. Create a focal point for our Design and User experience work, both for ourselves and for the community
