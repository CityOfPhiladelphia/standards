Montserrat is only used for major headlines that introduce sections of content. 

Open Sans is the base font for the site. It is used for body type, secondary and tertiary headlines, and instructional text.

Sans-serifs were chosen because they are easier to read on screens, and are adaptable across platforms and browsers.
