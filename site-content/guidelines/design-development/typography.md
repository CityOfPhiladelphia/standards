Montserrat is used to introduce sections of content on the site and is exclusively reserved for major headlines. Once we have their attention, we can draw them into the details with the highly-legible Open Sans.

Open Sans serves as the base font for the site. It is used to present the content details. Sans-serifs have been proven to be easier to read on-screen and are incredibly adaptable when resized and displayed across different platforms and browsers. Accordingly, Open Sans is used for body type, secondary and tertiary headlines, and instructional text.
