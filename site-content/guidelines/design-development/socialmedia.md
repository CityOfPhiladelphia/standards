The branding that you use on your department’s social media profiles should align with the City’s branding that we use on phila.gov. The brand should be reflected in your profile pictures, icons, header images and other imagery. For consistency, your header image should always match with the header image on your department site. Your profile picture can be your logo if you have one.
