The City of Philadelphia’s logo is the most visible representation of the city, its people, and its visual identity . The logo is a valuable asset that must be used consistently in the proper, approved forms.

There are two color versions of the City of Philadelphia logo provided. Consider context, contrast with background color, and surrounding imagery when selecting which version to use. 

The bell icon should always stay yellow, unless the entire logo must be one color. In those cases, use the black and white logo.   

Guidelines for using the City of Philadelphia logo:  
• Don’t recreate, crop, or reconfigure logo artwork.  
• Logo artwork must be uniformly scaled.  
• Logo artwork should appear against a solid background.  
• Don’t put a white box around the logo when placed on a dark background.  
• Don’t reproduce the logo in colors other than those specified.  
• Don’t add drop shadows.  
• Don’t change the orientation of the logo.  
• Don’t put text on top of logo.

## For departments  
If you’re a department that needs a logo, ODDT provides two templates for you below. They follow the same design as the City of Philadelphia logo, with the name of the department as the main focus. “City of Philadelphia” can go under the department name if you’d like. You may use either version.

Use the template provided for your department's social media channel avatar. The avatars are recognizable and readable when smaller.
