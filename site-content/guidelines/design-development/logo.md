The City of Philadelphia logo is the most visible representation of our city, our people, and our brand. It is a valuable asset that must be used consistently in the proper, approved forms.

There are two color versions of the City of Philadelphia logo provided. Consider context, contrast with background color, and surrounding imagery when selecting which version to use. 

The bell icon should ALWAYS stay yellow, unless the entire logo must be one color. In those cases, use the black and white logo. 

General set of guidelines for logo usage is outlined as follows:

1. Do not recreate, crop, or reconfigure logo artwork
2. Logo artwork must be uniformly scaled
3. Logo artwork should appear against a solid background
4. Do not put a white box around the logo when placed on a dark background. 
5. Do not reproduce the logo in colors other than those specified
6. Do not add drop shadows
7. Do not change the orientation of the logo
8. Do not put text on top of logo

## For Departments  
If you are a department that needs a logo, we provide two templates for you below. They follow the same design as the City of Philadelphia logo, with the name of the department as the main focus. “City of Philadelphia” can go under the department name if you’d like. You may use either version.

Use the template provided for your department's social media channel avatar. The avatars are recognizable and readable when smaller.
