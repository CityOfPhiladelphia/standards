Carefully considered photography brings another dimension to our city’s brand identity. The pictures we use should be expressive, show real people and emotions and be cropped for maximum effect. The attributes to apply to pictures are enjoying, optimistic, natural, clear, simple, real people in real situations. Your aim should be to convey a photojournalistic approach, creating a true sense of place, depicting real-life interaction between people. Never contrived or cliched. Our beautiful city has a personality, too. It can be a way to reinforce our brand by showing it’s character and the interesting people who populate it. Use dynamic lines, interesting angles and interesting crops to show personality.

Guidelines:  

1. Images must be at least 300 dpi  
2. Must use imagery that is not visibly dated  
3. Must be images that have been taken in Philadelphia  
4. No cell phone pictures  
5. Add photo credit where photo credit is due

## Implementation
All images are required to have alternate text. Good alternate text describes the image in its surrounding context. If an image contains text, that text must be the alternate text. If the image is purely visual and does not contain meaningful information, the alternate text can be blank, but the attribute must be present.

You can read more about alternate text on the <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" class="external">WebAIM website</a>.
