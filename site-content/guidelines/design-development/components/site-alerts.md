We have two types of alerts, service updates and site-wide alerts.

Service updates call out important time-sensitive information. They can be used on the homepage, and department landing pages if needed. They tell users the status of a system (transportation, trash, government facilities, etc). This includes errors as well as warnings.

Site-wide alerts are used to call out important information across the whole website. These are to be used in true emergencies only.
