Buttons are used for actions. The default color for buttons is electric blue. The text is dark gray. The hover state is dark gray with white text. An icon can be added if desired. â€œSee all" buttons should be used at the end of any incomplete list, including news, notices, services & information lists to indicate that the link or button will take the user to a complete list of that type of information.
